# Kudos to Open Source

[English](README.md) · [فارسی](README.fa.md)

> “What do we build for, if not to lessen each other’s hardship?”

A community-maintained catalog of open-source alternatives to proprietary software, with practical information about **where each project runs, how to install/use it, and important limitations before you switch**.

## Website

The repository includes a dependency-free static website for GitHub Pages with:

- instant search across proprietary products and open-source alternatives;
- **English / Persian language switching** with LTR/RTL support;
- focused A–Z categories such as **Video Editing, Video Players, Image Editing, IDE & Code Editors, LLM Runtimes, API Clients, CAD, GIS, Password Managers** and more;
- filtering by **platform**, category, licensing model, and fit;
- per-project **Install / use** links;
- **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Web, Docker, CLI, VS Code, JetBrains** and other runtime tags;
- concise **Things to know / limitations** tags;
- shareable search/filter URLs, responsive design, and light/dark themes.

Build it locally:

```bash
python scripts/validate.py
python scripts/build_site.py
python -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Browse by category

The focused category index is generated from the catalog and kept alphabetically sorted:

- [Browse all categories A–Z](categories/README.md)
- [مرور دسته‌بندی‌ها](categories/README.fa.md)

## Data architecture

Project metadata is normalized so installation/platform information is defined once even when one open-source project replaces several proprietary products.

```text
data/
├── alternatives.yml       # mappings: proprietary product -> project
├── projects.yml           # project URL, setup URL, license, platforms, limitations
├── categories.json        # stable category IDs
├── locales.json           # enabled languages
└── locales/
    ├── en.json            # UI, categories, tags, mapping notes
    └── fa.json
          │
          ├── scripts/validate.py
          ├── scripts/generate.py ──→ categories/*/README*.md
          └── scripts/build_site.py ─→ dist/ → GitHub Pages
```

Adding another language does **not** require frontend changes. Add the locale file and register its language code; see [docs/i18n.md](docs/i18n.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome: new alternatives, better setup links, platform corrections, license/model corrections, translation improvements, and clearer limitation tags are all valuable.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). CI validates that every project has a setup link, at least one platform, at least one constraint/limitation tag, and complete locale coverage.

## Important caveat

No catalog can literally contain every open-source alternative forever. Projects launch, archive, fork, change platforms, and relicense. The goal is a **high-quality, continuously maintained catalog**, not an unverifiable claim of completeness.

The repository's original content and helper scripts are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Each linked project retains its own license, trademarks, and copyrights.
